    "\n",
    "I got the nikutama curry udon and my partner got the tonkotsu. I loved the curry udon but WOW the broth on the tonkotsu was so delicious. Would highly recommend the tonkotsu if you love bold flavors. I loved the beef and the egg on the nikutama though. The regular was more than enough for both of us, especially with the added tempura. The shrimp and potato croquette tempura were my favorite, and we also got the chicken katsu one that was really good as well.\n",

    "Marugame has been a go-to since my college days. \"Conveyer\" belt udon with tempura of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "My favorite has always been the Mentai Kamatama ($8.25 for regular size). It's more of a dry udon dish with minimal sauce and pollock roe. The flavor is clean but still savory and memorable. The crunchy tempura crisps and green onion toppings add another level of umami to the dish.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the tempura, highly recommend the ebi (shrimp). The batter is light and you can still taste the sweetness of the shrimp. I also tried the potato croquette, squid, and chicken tempura. The shrimp is still the best followed by the chicken, potato, then squid.\n",

    "FLAVOR (3.5/5):\n",
    "Kitsune Udon: The Kitsune Udon is a solid choice when going to Marugame. The tofu is sweet (a bit too sweet for my liking), but it's a light dish that still leaves you full at the end of the meal. I also got the potato croquette, and it had a sweet flavor. If I were to come back, I'd definitely want to try the Curry Udon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of sides, I wish there were more options besides the tempura or maybe just more types of tempura. But overall, I was satisfied.\n",

    "As the biggest udon fan, I love Marugame! The line moves swift and you're able to get your udon super fast. It's so convenient to step into line, grab the tempura and croquettes you want, pay at the counter, and eat your meal to your heart's content at your own speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ordered the Nikutama udon and the meat is so flavorful! Paired with the bouncy udon noodles, it makes for an amazing meal. Even though I got a small, I was so full by the end of it.\n",

    "Throughout my years of college, Marugame is probably the most frequented restaurant, not only on Sawtelle but just generally. This is because it's super convenient. Line moves fast, food comes quick, and is always a solid meal. In my many visits to Marugame, I usually get the Nikutama and I don't really get tired of it. I'm also always a bit worried about trying something new because I've never liked other udons as much as the Nikutama.\n",
    "This time, I tried the curry nikutama. I am not sure why, but the flavor of the curry nikutama was just not what I was expecting. While it wasn't bad, I don't think I would get it again. Their menu is also not very vast, which can be a plus or not depending on what you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish I could give it 5 stars, but I have noticed the pricing increase a lot recently, which is kinda disappointing since we often go to Marugame expecting a cheaper meal. I paid ~$17 for the curry nikutama + a potato croquette.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "review6 = '''\n",
    "I mean... you can't go wrong with a $5.5 hearty bowl of udon. For a regular size, it is FILLING and very affordable! With the tempura sides that you can pick to your heart's content, it's a very satisfying meal. The assembly style of ordering is quick, convenient, and practical. Very reminiscent of the udon fast-food chains in Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been here a number of times, and even when the line's long, it goes by relatively quickly. On a Thursday around 7:30PM, there was virtually no wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's your first time here, you can't go wrong with a simple Kake (dashi broth). I added their new Gekikara Fireball for 0.50 cents, and it was worth if you like spice. I only added half and it was more than enough kick.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't recommend the curry imo, as I remember it being lackluster in flavor, and salty if anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "My personal favorite tempura add-ons; a bit pricey, albeit a must:  \n",
    "- Shrimp ($2.25) - a staple!\n",
    "- Squid ($2.25) - crunchy on the outside, and juicy and chewy on the inside.\n",

    "This place was great! I came in on a Sunday at 4:30pm and there was no line and plenty of seating. (When we left around 5:30 the line was out the door).  The way it was set up was similar to a cafeteria line. I ordered the tonkatsu with all the fixings ~green onion and tempura flakes~ along with some tempura mushrooms and shrimp skewers. I also got the ginger berry oolong tea what they make in house.\n",
    "\n",
    "I liked how they had a little bar area for chili, ginger, tempura sauce and water as well as a self serve to-go box/bag area. Since there wasn't any table service, you sat yourselves and brought your finished meals to the cleaning area as well. The bathrooms were also very clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving onto the food, the noodles were very chewy and cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the broth from the tonkatsu since it was really rich to where the noodles soaked up all that flavor. I especially liked the mushroom tempura since they were very juicy. One thing I wish they had was soy sauce since I like my tempura with soy sauce since it has a stronger flavor than the tempura sauce offered, but that is just a personal preference. Overall this place was very good, probably the next udon place I've been to yet.\n",
    "'''\n",

    "Their udon is always so chewy and yummy! My fav part is the meat and I'm full off a regular bowl!! They also have tempura if you're in the mood for some of that. It's cafeteria style and the line typically goes by fast if theyre busy.\n",

    "I am from OC, and before they opened one in costa mesa, I would come here an unhealthy amount of times. Like everytime I planned a trip to LA, I would make sure I came to Marugame Udon for some delicious beef udon and tempura. I dont know what else to say, but they have the best udon I have ever tried. The egg is literally to die for and the way they crack it in your bowl and you see it just floating on top of your bowl is crazy to me. They put a good amount of meat in your bowl and I just inhale my meal everytime i eat here. You have to add green onions, tempura, and chilli powder to your udon because those toppings are what makes it more flavorful and savory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For parking, you can park in the structure, it is super cheap if you only come to eat for a bit, I usually pay around $2 or something, so its not one of those super expensive LA parking structures. They have more locations now so it is not just the one in Sawtelle. I am so glad there's one in OC and I dont have to drive an hour to get some delicious udon!\n",

    "Noodles... IYKYK... noodles are my THING.  And these were some of the very best.  I hate to even compare to my local Udon spot, but this place killed it.  The noodles were incredibly fresh (tender with the perfect bite!)  and the broth was on point. The regular Kake Udon was the best example of traditional Udon Ive had in a minute! I got the BK udon and added a spring egg- just fantastic.   They constantly making tempura and so the tempura flakes are fresh and really crispy. I truly almost went  back for lunch today- twice in 2 days?? THATS HOW GOOD IT WAS.\n",

    "\n",
    "Love the curry udon although the curry is thick like gravy. Even if there's a long line out the door, the wait isn't that long. It's always clean and they have outdoor seating. One request though, lower tables as the booth like seats are too low for me.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The broth was very flavorful and the udon noodles were chewy and springy. I loved the addition of the tempura flakes, spicy meat, and green onions. They gave the broth a nice kick and the flakes added texture. The slice of meat was soft and slightly fatty, which is how I like it. My only complaint was that the egg was overly cooked.\n",

    "I don't have udon very often... but Marguame is one of the best I've had. The food was definitely worth all 5 stars, but that line... There's gotta be a faster or more efficient way to tame that line. Although we did not wait over an hour, I've heard horror stories of such waits. I mean the food is worth checking out, but the long lines may deter people from trying. It did move quickly, but I can see it getting crazyyy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a cafeteria type of restaurant, soups/bowls first then the sides. Which I think they should switch up... Cause once I sat down the soup wasn't as hot. The sides included: shrimp, squid, chicken & veggies ALL dipped in tempura batter. They did have a chicken katsu type which I didn't get to try. For my bowl I got the Nikatuma which included beef, egg & BK sauce (couldn't tell ya what this is haha) [$10.95- Regular; $12.50-Large] Believe me, that udon was sooo good & filling, I could not finish my regular bowl! The meat reminded me of Yoshina meat- which was always on point- IYKYK! We tried the shrimp, squid & chicken tempura sides and it was also really good, nothing too special about it.\n",

    "If Udon isn't your thing, they do have chicken or beef rice bowls which I heard were really great too. I'll have to try that next time. Yes, there will be a next time, just hoping for a shorter line! Lots of seating inside & a few tables on their patio.

One of the reasons why I love Marugame is you get your food instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I always get the curry udon. The noodles are fresh and springy. For dinner, make sure you get there around 5:30-6pm which is before the dinner rush. After and you will have to wait in a long line. (But the line does move quickly)\n",

My only complaint is that the soft boiled egg in the Tonkatsu bowl was hard boiled. (I'm used to soft boiled eggs but maybe it's supposed to be hard boiled?) There wasn't a long line like the ones in Honolulu. We got in very quickly.\n",
