## About Me
I'm a 4th year Computer Science with a tech breadth focus in Digital Humanities and Tech Management. I am interested and passionate about graphic design, user interaction, and the intersection between art and technology. My experience mostly lies in front-end and full stack web and mobile applications, and I have also dabbled in UI/UX design working with organizations and clubs both at and outside of UCLA. 

I am taking this course because I want to strengthen my knowledge of Python and also learn to apply my coding skills to humanities project beyond the type of technical projects that I am already familiar with. For project ideas, I am interested in exploring datasets that involves Pop Culture, Music, or Cultural trends in Los Angeles to look deeper into the city that is my home.
